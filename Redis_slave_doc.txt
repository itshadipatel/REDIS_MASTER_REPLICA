Create a Replica/Slave of Master Redis on a new server
1>Login into the new server
RUN REDIS SERVER
1> run Command
$ redis-server

2> IF ALREADY RUNNING THEN FIND THE PROCESS ID AND KILL IT
    Find the redis process id
    ps aux | grep redis
     
    Kill the redis process
    kill -9 PROCESS_ID

3> THEN RUN AGAIN redis-server
now the server will show you the messages at runtime so make sure you take a look at it after executing the redis commands

4> OPEN A NEW TAB (You might need to login into the server again. )
run command
$ redis-cli
This will show
127.0.0.1:6379>

5> Verify Your Redis Server is Working
127.0.0.1:6379> ping
 PONG  <----------- OUTPUT

6> CONFIGURE THE MASTER with AUTHENTICATION
127.0.0.1:6379> config set masterauth YOUR_AUTH_KEY_GOES_HERE
OK   <---------------- OUTPUT

7>
127.0.0.1:6379> REPLICAOF MASTER_HOSTNAME PORT
OK

8> CHECK redis-server tab for ANY MESSAGES
IF SUCCESS THEN IT WILL PRINT THE SUCCESS MESSAGE
last 3 line of the message would be
 * MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: Flushing old data
 * MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: Loading DB in memory
 * MASTER <-> REPLICA sync: Finished with success

9> note:- If you encounter this error,
-- Can't handle RDB format version 9
then you need to take a look at your redis version and if it is not upto date then remove and install the stable version of redis
